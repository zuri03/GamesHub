# GamesHub
A simple react page with a collection of simple games. 
I am using this as a way to gain further experience using react and css
While this project is a way from me to learn frontend development the emphasis is on the backend development since that is my strong suit. 
So far the game logic is the only "backend" code I have however, I do plan to add a server to the project in the fututre.
